# RESTcord-CLI
The CLI for RESTcord, made so that you can interact with Discord through a command line. See below for a tutorial.

## Installing
To start, just download this repository as a ZIP file. Follow by extracting it, and opening a terminal/command prompt window in the directory.

If you don't already have node.js, get it at https://nodejs.org/.

In the terminal/cmd, type `npm i`. This will install all the dependencies.

## Configuration
There's only one thing to configure here, which is the **hostname**. This is where RESTcord.js is running. Just edit it in `config.json` to your liking, or keep it at the defaults if they're correct.

## Running
In the terminal/cmd, just type `node index.js`. This will launch the app. Enjoy!
